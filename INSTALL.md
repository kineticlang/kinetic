# Installing and running Kinetic

These instructions describe Kinetic 1.5.0. The version is declared in
[package configuration](pyproject.toml).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer, with a version supported by the llvmlite release you install.
  A stable Python release is recommended; prerelease interpreters may not have
  compatible llvmlite wheels.
- llvmlite, the only runtime Python dependency, constrained to the 0.45 release
  series in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). This is not an exact patch pin.
- Clang on your executable search path for native builds and execution.

Clang is a separate toolchain dependency; installing the Python requirements
does not install it. Static repository checks need only Python.

## Work directly from a checkout

From the repository root, install the dependency listed in
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt):

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The root [launcher](kinetic.py) works without installing Kinetic itself:

```shell
python kinetic.py build examples/01_hello.kn
python kinetic.py run examples/01_hello.kn
```

The module entry point is also available:

```shell
python -m compiler run examples/01_hello.kn
```

## Optional editable installation

The [package configuration](pyproject.toml) installs the single
[compiler package](compiler/README.md):

```shell
python -m pip install -e .
```

This also installs the command-line entry point:

```shell
kinetic run examples/01_hello.kn
```

The editable installation reads its runtime dependency from the same
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt), so the two installation paths share one
dependency list. Paths to input programs are relative to your current working
directory. The run command forwards arguments after the source path to the
program, where the `arg_count` and `arg` builtins can read them:

```shell
python kinetic.py run examples/12_host_io.kn alpha beta
```

## Build output

Both build and run write textual LLVM IR and a native executable next to the
input source. Windows executables have the usual executable extension;
Unix-like executables have no extension. The run command builds first and then
starts the resulting executable.

Clang may print a warning about overriding the module target triple. On its own,
that warning is not a build failure.

Common generated outputs are covered by [.gitignore](.gitignore). Remove artifacts
after manual verification, especially binaries from newly added examples.

The [example catalog](examples/README.md) includes thirteen valid numbered programs,
compile-time failures, runtime bounds failures, and warning demonstrations. The bootstrap status and byte
examples use the existing language; the proposed host services are not installed
by these setup commands.

Regenerate existing IR and binaries when upgrading to 1.2.1 to pick up the
heap-backed array-lifetime and allocation-failure fixes. The pointer/count
representation introduced in 1.2.0 is unchanged. Array storage now lives until
process exit and is not reclaimed; failed nonempty-array allocations trap before
initialization. These fixes use the existing C runtime and add no dependency to
the installation steps.

An invalid runtime index, a failed nonempty-array allocation, an unreadable
input file, or an out-of-range program argument traps and returns
failure from the run command; the exact native exit status or signal is
platform-dependent. The runtime-failure examples demonstrate bounds and
host-I/O failures
and must not be included in a success-only build-and-run loop.

## Static checks without a compiler toolchain

```shell
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_layout.py -v
```

This does not require llvmlite or Clang and does not compile or run Kinetic code.
See [tests](tests/README.md) for the scope of these checks and the separate
behavioral commands. The general [runner](tools/check.py) is not static-only:
it discovers backend tests that generate IR when llvmlite is installed.
